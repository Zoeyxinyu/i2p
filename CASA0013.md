### 1. Who collected the data?

The original source of data is the Airbnb website and Murry Cox and Tom Slee collected the data. Murry founded the Inside Airbnb project to provide data and tools to help understand Airbnb’s impact on different aspects of society [1].

---

### 2. Why did they collect it?

The Inside Airbnb website is not associated with Airbnb or its competitors [2], so we can believe that the reason why they collected the data was to provide relatively unbiased information (compared with data reported by Airbnb itself) to people like urban analysts and academics to do further investigation. As a result, we can expect that less information is deliberately removed or hidden from the dataset.

---

### 3. How was it collected?

The dataset was assembled by programmatically compiling public information from Airbnb’s website [1]. Specifically, they used programming languages like Python to scrape that public information from the Airbnb website, then cleansed and aggregated the data to produce a csv file. As a result, some information that does not appear on the Airbnb website will also not appear in that dataset.

### 4. What useful information does it contain?

Looking at the dataset, we can find information about both hosts and accommodation. What information is useful depends on the specific problem we want to focus on. For instance, location information such as latitude and longitude is useful if we want to do some spatial analysis. 

In addition, since the data was obtained at a specific point in time, we should concern if some values change within a period frequently. For example, data in the column ‘host_response_time’ may be not suitable in the subsequent study as it is very up to date.

---

### 5. To what extent is the data 'complete'?

When measuring the completeness of the dataset, we need to think about what information it lacks. On the surface, there are some null values in this dataset. This type of missing value is not a serious problem, because they can be compensated by technical means. Another type of missing is structural, which can cause more serious problems and it is also the main point I want to discuss here.

The dataset did not show the information about hosts’ gender and race. We can think that this is because Airbnb wants to avoid any sexism and racial discrimination. However, avoiding disclosing does not mean that they do not exist. If some customers hold prejudices, they can still distinguish the background of hosts and only choose those hosts belonging to a certain group of people. Racism exists as a matter of fact, and its existence is supported by the overwhelming empirical evidence that documents instances of structural racism [3]. Do white hosts get more positive reviews? Is there a significant difference between the price of a white host’s room and that of a person of colour? We cannot get access to explore these questions if the relevant data is hidden deliberately. This kind of incompleteness of data limits the scope of our research.

### 6. What kinds of analysis would this support?

Based on the information about Airbnb listings provided by this data set, we can combine relevant data in other fields to study the impacts of Airbnb on the different aspects of society. 
Airbnb provides an online accommodation platform connecting tourists and local homeowners, potentially affecting the hotel market [4] and, more recently, the housing market [5]. A study based on Airbnb listing data from the entire United States showed that a 10% increase in Airbnb listings leads to a 0.42% increase in rents and a 0.76% increase in house prices [6]. 

We can also study the impact of the number of Airbnb listings on the local tourism industry. For example, whether the increase in the number of listings can attract more tourists, thereby promoting the development of the local tourism industry. 

In addition, we can also explore how people’s attitudes towards the sharing economy have changed with the booming development of Airbnb. Are people more willing to participate in the sharing economy or are they less receptive to it than in the past when their life has been influenced more or less by Airbnb? And think whether there are some social influences that are not reflected in the dataset behind the change in people’s attitude.

### 7. Which of the uses presented in Q.6 are _ethical_?

Before we delve into further study, the first thing we should take into consideration is whether the data collection process complies with laws and ethics. Can we simply assume that the hosts agree with other institutions to use their personal information provided on Airbnb elsewhere? Or can we agree that once the information has been shared and consent has been given, it is no longer private anymore? Binary notions of privacy are particularly dangerous and can erode trust in our era of big data and metadata, in which private information is necessarily shared by design in order to be useful. Neither shared private data nor metadata should forfeit their ability to be protected merely because they are held in intermediate states [7]. We should strike a balance between protecting the privacy and performing fantastic data analysis, which is the ethical premise of our use of this Airbnb dataset.

I mentioned three different questions that we can do some analysis in Q.6. Considering whether they are ethical from a perspective of the purpose of each research, I think we can believe that they are all ethical. However, the results of data analysis may still cause unexpected harm to individuals or groups of people even when our intentions are good. For example, when talking about the language used to describe low-income communities, we unconsciously tend to use a language of deficiency, calling them disadvantaged, under-resourced and under-everything else, which ignores all the richness those communities and their young people possess: the wealth of resiliency, tenacity and grit that can turn into greatness if properly cultivated [3]. Therefore, we must not only be satisfied that the purpose of the research meets the ethical requirements, but must integrate the human values of privacy, transparency, and respect throughout the entire research to ensure the uses of the data do not deviate from ethical standards.
